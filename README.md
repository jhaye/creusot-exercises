# Creusot Exercises

This repository contains a series of exercises to introduce the [Creusot](https://github.com/xldenis/creusot) deductive verifier for Rust.
They currently presuppose a certain background knowledge in mathematics and formal logic but eventually should also provide an introduction to program verification too.
